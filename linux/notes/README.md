Analysis of my first experience in engaging with the terminal:

The Bandit game allowed me to navigate the terminal with more confidence. I learned the importance of using the `man` pages when encountering unfamiliar commands. Overall, the problem-solving and critical thinking required throughout the challenges gave me a deeper understanding of terminal usage, especially in terms of file manipulation and permissions. The security-focused challenges toward the end provided valuable insights into security awareness.
